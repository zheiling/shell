# Command line iterpretator
This project is my playground, take not it serious!

## Known bugs and tasks:
- [ ] When there is a zombie process, command line invitation prints after the command output

- [x] Process correctly commands without spaces like:
`yes|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat>/dev/null&` 

- [x] Analyze the entered word and break it down by suffixes and prefixes. Change directory of search in case of `par_dir/chld_dir/file`

- [x] Fully rewrite the line after using Tab with multiple answers

- [x] Check output of the suggestions from the PATH in order to find a bug.

- [ ] Process group management
